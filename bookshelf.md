# Bookshelf

A collection of resources online and offline I've utilised to further my knowledge both relating to computer science and other areas. Feel free to jump straight to [online courses](#online-courses) or [books](#books).

## Online courses

### Certified

Here's the courses I've gotten certifications for:

* Several [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certifications, currently up to and including Scientific Computing with Python.
* [PHP for Beginners - Become a PHP Master - CMS Project](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-82d18ec7-f503-42e1-9faa-dc2d09cf0c8e/) on Udemy - maybe not the best-crafted coding course out there, but helped me get finally dip my feet into coding in PHP and spark an interest in web development.

### Audited

Often, instead of pursuing a certification, I audit the course instead, so I can access the material and most of the exercises without a paywall. Since in that case I don't have certifications to help me keep track of the courses I've done, here's a list:

* [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) (didn't finish completely due to the free trial limit of 30 days, but did, submitted, and improved according to code reviews several of the learning projects)
* [Data Science: Visualization](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/data-science-visualization?delta=3) from Harvard University
* [Data Science: R Basics](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/data-science-r-basics) from Harvard University

## Books

Some of these were recommended to me by my professors, others found in bibliographies of papers I've studied, yet others - in random places on the Internet.

* _Punishment and Responsibility - Essays in the Philosophy of Law_ by H.L.A. Hart
* _The Mythical Man-Month_ by Fred Brooks
* _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_ by Eric S. Raymond
* _The Design of Everyday Things_ by Donald A. Norman
