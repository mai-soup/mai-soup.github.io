# About Me

Hey there! I'm Maijs Garais (_my's gah-rye-s_, IPA: /maɪjs garaɪs/; I also go by Mai for short), a highly motivated and enthusiastic student at the University of Leeds studying Computer Science. I'm still exploring and trying to find out what branches of computer science I'd like to pursue as a career, but I have worked as an Android developer in the past and am currently deepening my understanding of web development.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maijs-garais/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mai-soup).

## Site information

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator. The CSS is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) v5.0, with a few tweaks by me.

The coding and writing is done on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Landing page photo shot on a [Zenit](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit_(camera)>).
