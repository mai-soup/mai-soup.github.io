# About Me

Hey there! My name is Maijs Garais (_my's gah-rye-s_, IPA: /maɪjs garaɪs/; I also go by Mai for short), and I am an enthusiastic developer with a passion for learning and getting better. I have worked as an Android Developer in the past, but currently am more focused on web development, in particular using React.js.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maijs-garais/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mai-soup).

## Site information

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator. The CSS is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) v5.0, with a few tweaks by me.

The coding and writing is done on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Landing page photo shot on a [Zenit](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit_(camera)>).
