# About Me

Hey there! My name is Maijs Garais (_my's gah-rye-s_, IPA: /maɪjs garaɪs/; I also go by Mai for short), and I am a full-stack developer. I have worked as an Android Developer in the past, but currently am more focused on web development, in particular using the MERN and MEVN stacks.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually reading, walking unnecessarily long trails, playing videogames, or hanging out at one of the tech meetups in town.

## Site information

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator. Styling is mine, the homepage glitch effect is cobbled together from various CodePen submissions.

The coding and writing is done on [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), a freely licensed binary of Microsoft's VS Code. Landing page photo shot on a [Zenit](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit_(camera)>).
