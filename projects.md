# Projects

Here's the various projects I am working/have worked on, and the links to their repositories.

## YelpCamp

My current work-in-progress: a site for users to browse campgrounds and leave reviews on them, as well as add new campgrounds to the database, including images to be displayed which are stored on Cloudinary. Features include authentication, authorisation, sessions/cookies, (multiple) file upload, cluster and individual campground maps, form validation (both client- and server-side), CSS transitions to make the site fun to use, among others.

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Mapbox API

## My personal website

The website you're on was built from scratch by me! I had some experience with static site generators such as Hugo, but wanted to try Jekyll out, so I thought an autobiographical website was as good a chance to do that as any. Design-wise it was inspired by my love of retro technology and digital minimalism.

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Jekyll

## Madness of Warblade

A project I work on in my spare time using the Godot game engine, Madness of Warblade is a short dungeon crawler and the first game of mine. It follows the main character as they enter a dungeon looking for a fabled warblade and fight their way to it.

The development has currently slowed down, as I am focusing more on level design and UX, trying to ensure the gameplay flows as smoothly as reasonably possible for a first project in game development. It is making me learn a lot about user experience and how to make simple interactions more fun.

**Technologies**: Godot game engine, GDScript

## Various Android projects

While working for CUBE Systems and CUBE Mobile, I worked on several applications in Android Java, including:
* [Trains in Latvia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.amberphone.pasazieruvilciens), the official app for Latvia's public rail transport service provider (bugfixes and issues with ticket PDF generation),
* [Latvijas Pasts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.pasts.app), the official app for Latvia's main state-owned postal service provider (implementing parcel tracking in-app),
* [Tolders](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.tolders), an app for finding discounts (moving to a new version of the API, design changes).
