# Projects

Here's the various projects I am working/have worked on, and the links to their repositories.

## YelpCamp

![YelpCamp landing page](/images/projects/yelpcamp.png){:class="img-fluid"}

My current work-in-progress: a site for users to browse campgrounds and leave reviews on them, as well as add new campgrounds to the database, including images to be displayed which are stored on Cloudinary. Features include authentication, authorisation, sessions/cookies, (multiple) file upload, cluster and individual campground maps, form validation (both client- and server-side), CSS transitions to make the site fun to use, among others.

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Mapbox API, Cloudinary

Though not finished, there is a [deployed version](https://yelpcamp-aqzy.onrender.com/), however be aware that it might initially take a couple minutes to load and have some 404s for the first few seconds after it's first rendered while the server fully boots up. Drawbacks of using free tiers of appplication hosting - all the resources are being throttled! If it still doesn't work properly after 3 minutes or so, email me at mai-soup [at] mailfence [dot] com.

## react colour picker

![react colour picker's landing page](/images/projects/react-colour-picker.png){:class="img-fluid"}

My first project using React! View colour palettes at various lightness levels as well as make your own. Made as part of Colt Steele's React bootcamp, though I decided to use functional components and hooks instead of class components, as well as had to switch out a few outdated packages, so while my end result largely looks the same, the code is quite different. I'm still working on polishing up the UI design and layout, but the app is functional and responsive too!

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, React.js, React Router, Material UI, MUI's `styled` utility

There is an [online version](https://react-colour-picker.vercel.app/) available (data is only saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so feel free to play around). If anything is not working properly, let me know at mai-soup [at] mailfence [dot] com.

## Hangman

The classic game, made using React and Tailwind in an attempt to get familiar with the CSS framework. Making it was a lot of fun, and I spent way too much time "testing" the app out once the functionality was working, haha.

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, React.js, Tailwind

## Various Frontend Mentor Projects

As there are several of these and they are smaller than my other projects, I made a separate page to showcase them.

## My personal website

The website you're on was built from scratch by me! I had some experience with static site generators such as Hugo, but wanted to try Jekyll out, so I thought an autobiographical website was as good a chance to do that as any. Design-wise it was inspired by my love of retro technology and digital minimalism.

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Jekyll

## Madness of Warblade

![A screenshot of the game](/images/projects/madness.png){:class="img-fluid"}

A project I work on in my spare time using the Godot game engine, Madness of Warblade is a short dungeon crawler and the first game of mine. It follows the main character as they enter a dungeon looking for a fabled warblade and fight their way to it.

The development has currently slowed down, as I am focusing more on level design and UX, trying to ensure the gameplay flows as smoothly as reasonably possible for a first project in game development. It is making me learn a lot about user experience and how to make simple interactions more fun.

**Technologies**: Godot game engine, GDScript

## Various Android projects

While working for CUBE Systems and CUBE Mobile, I worked on several applications in Android Java, including:

- [Trains in Latvia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.amberphone.pasazieruvilciens), the official app for Latvia's public rail transport service provider (bugfixes and issues with ticket PDF generation),
- [Latvijas Pasts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.pasts.app), the official app for Latvia's main state-owned postal service provider (implementing parcel tracking in-app),
- [Tolders](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.tolders), an app for finding discounts (moving to a new version of the API, design changes).
