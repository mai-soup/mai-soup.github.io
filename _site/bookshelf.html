<p>A collection of resources online and offline I’ve utilised to further my knowledge both relating to computer science and other areas. Feel free to jump straight to <a href="#online-courses">online courses</a> or <a href="#books">books</a>.</p>

<h2 id="online-courses">Online courses</h2>

<h3 id="certified">Certified</h3>

<p>Here’s the courses I’ve gotten certifications for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Several <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> certifications, currently up to and including Scientific Computing with Python.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-82d18ec7-f503-42e1-9faa-dc2d09cf0c8e/">PHP for Beginners - Become a PHP Master - CMS Project</a> on Udemy - maybe not the best-crafted coding course out there, but helped me get finally dip my feet into coding in PHP and spark an interest in web development.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-5faed6db-8c99-423c-83d1-491780de194f/">The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023</a> by Colt Steele - an incredibly well-crafted web development course that covered everything from the very basics of HTML and CSS to using Node and Express and deploying apps.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-dbfb4f5d-a3be-4165-84ba-571015da7b08/">The Modern React Bootcamp</a> by Colt Steele - the best frontend course I’ve come across so far, Colt explains things in an easy to understand way that builds upon previous knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="audited">Audited</h3>

<p>Often, instead of pursuing a certification, I audit the course instead, so I can access the material and most of the exercises without a paywall. Since in that case I don’t have certifications to help me keep track of the courses I’ve done, here’s a list:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801">Android Developer Nanodegree</a> (didn’t finish completely due to the free trial limit of 30 days, but did, submitted, and improved according to code reviews several of the learning projects)</li>
  <li><a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/data-science-visualization?delta=3">Data Science: Visualization</a> from Harvard University</li>
  <li><a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/data-science-r-basics">Data Science: R Basics</a> from Harvard University</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>Some of these were recommended to me by my professors, others found in bibliographies of papers I’ve studied, yet others - in random places on the Internet.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Punishment and Responsibility - Essays in the Philosophy of Law</em> by H.L.A. Hart</li>
  <li><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> by Fred Brooks</li>
  <li><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em> by Eric S. Raymond</li>
  <li><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> by Donald A. Norman</li>
</ul>
